2. Read codes from TensorFlow tutorials of your interets: https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/index.html
3. Read the implementation of VAE in TensorFlow here: https://jmetzen.github.io/2015-11-27/vae.html
4. Improvements: 
Try batch normalization;
Try convnets;
Try conditional VAE.

One question to think about: When trying out covnet, where should we put conv layers and where should we put fully connected layers?
