Requirements from Prof. Canny:
1. Use TensorFlow
2. Use CLEANED dataset
3. Make comparison with existing neural networks/state-of-the-art algorithms
4. Can refer to the papers suggested in lec06.pdf
5. The proposal will be due in the next few weeks


Personal suggestions to make life easier
1. Comment codes but avoid unnecessary comments.
2. Separate different parts of codes as much as possible.
