Requirements/suggestions from Prof. Canny:
1. Use TensorFlow
2. Use CLEANED dataset (purpose of project is deep learning, not "deep data mining/cleaning")
3. Make comparison with existing neural networks/state-of-the-art algorithms
4. Can refer to the papers suggested in lec06.pdf
5. The proposal will be due in the next few weeks
6. Re-implementing things from existing papers is a viable project? (according to Prof. Canny?)


Personal suggestions to make life easier
1. Comment codes but avoid unnecessary comments.
2. Separate different parts of codes as much as possible.
