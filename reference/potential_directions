Requirements/suggestions from Prof. Canny:
1. Use TensorFlow
2. Use CLEANED dataset (purpose of project is deep learning, not "deep data mining/cleaning")
3. Make comparison with existing neural networks/state-of-the-art algorithms
4. Can refer to the papers suggested in lec06.pdf
5. The proposal will be due in the next few weeks
6. Re-implementing things from existing papers is a viable project? (according to Prof. Canny?)


Personal suggestions to make life easier
1. Comment codes but avoid unnecessary comments.
2. Separate different parts of codes as much as possible.

Potential applications of GAN and VAE:
A super-resolution
A1. super-resolution via VAE:
http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/files/eccv_2014_deepresolution.pdf / https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00092.pdf (same paper)
Comments: Super-resolution is an ill-posed inverse problem. Using VAE enables one to incorperate information from a large set of image data.
A2. super-resolution via GAN:
https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802
Comments: The discriminator network is used to differentiate between the high-resolution images and low-resolution images.

Vision tasks related to the above two tasks have been quite well intestigated. What about sounds? Can we discriminate speech from noise? (though I believe it's also been investigated) Further, what about the universe? For example, in the study of cosmic microwave background. For example, can we find aliens from noisy data received from the universe?
