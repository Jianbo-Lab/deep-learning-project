# deep-learning-project

The directory core contains vae.py, which contains the basic variational auto-encoder with both the encoder network and the decoder network as inputs. 

The directory networks contains 
simple_fc.py: Both the encoder and the decoder are fully connected networks.
ops.py: It contains some layers to be used by networks. 

The directory notebook contains all jupyter notebook files that demonstrate the experiments.
